So as my [previous prject](https://github.com/superyngo/snake_spaghetti_style_code) promised,
I made another snake game with below feature:

- svelte component
- OOT snake
- state management
- kind of clean code
- RWD
- touch screen supported

usage:

```ts
<div class="wrapper">
  <Snake canvasWidth={10} canvasHeight={10} speed={3} />
</div>
```
